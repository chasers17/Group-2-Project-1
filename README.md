PROJECT TITLE – TRENDS IN MEDICARE CLAIMS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR 
DISEASE 

TEAM MEMBERS:
Joanna, Sanja, Zunyan, Chase, Noah

PROJECT DESCRIPTION OUTLINE:
Our project will be analyzing trends in Medicare claims for 6 different categories of 
cardiovascular disease by year, state and demographic groups. Which states have 
the highest rate of cardiovascular medicare claims?  How have the rates of 
Medicare claims changed over the decades (by states, by types, etc)? Do the 
priority groups show that they have actually reduced the incidence of 
cardiovascular claims by a statistically significant margin? Which demographic 
group would have the highest incidence of cardiovascular claims? Which type of 
cardiovascular disease claim has the highest incidence? Do Southern states have a 
higher incidence of cardiovascular disease – validate or not validate our 
assumptions.
